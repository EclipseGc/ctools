Upgrading from ctools-6.x-1.x to ctools-7.x-2.x:

  - All calls to ctools_static*() should be replaced with corresponding calls
    to drupal_static*().
  - All calls to ctools_css_add_css should be replaced with calls to
    drupal_add_css(). Note that the arguments to drupal_add_css() have changed.
  - Plugin types now must be explicitly registered via a registration hook,
    hook_ctools_plugin_type(); info once provided in magically-named functions
    (e.g., ctools_ctools_plugin_content_types() was the old function to
    provide plugin type info for ctools' content_type plugins) now must be
    provided in that global hook. See http://drupal.org/node/910538 for more
    details.
